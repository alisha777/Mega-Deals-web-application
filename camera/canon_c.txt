Recording Functions 

Standard
* Records to either the CF card or SD card.
Auto switch card
* When the current card becomes full, the camera switches to the other card automatically.
Record separately
* The CF card and SD card record the same image at a different image recording quality (L, M, S1, S2, S3, RAW, M-RAW, S-RAW)
Record to multiple
* Both the CF card and SD card record the same image at the same image recording quality. (Also applies to RAW+JPEG, M+JPEG, and SRAW+JPEG)
Backup Recording 
Images recorded in a card can be copied to the other card

File Numbering 
The following three types of file numbers can be set:

(1) Continuous numbering

* The continuous numbering of captured images will continue even after you replace the camera's card. (The numbering continues even when the folder changes.)

(2) Auto reset

* When you replace the camera's card, the numbering will be reset to start from 0001. If the new card already contains images, the numbering will continue from the last recorded image in the card.

(3) Manual reset

* Resets the file number to 0001, and creates a new folder automatically.

RAW + JPEG Simultaneous Recording 
The image-recording quality can be selected in any combination of the three RAW and eight JPEG recording quality settings.
