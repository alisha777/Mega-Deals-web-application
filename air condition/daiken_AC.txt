Daikin US7 Series
Model	Cooling Capacities (kw)	Prices From (Approx)
US7	2.5, 3.5, 5.0	$2,000


The Daikin US7 is the company’s super-efficient model, having earned a 7-star efficiency rating. It’s also approved by the National Asthma Council and boasts humidifying and dehumidifying capabilities. Daikin claims it is the most energy-efficient split system in Australia, and its accolades certainly suggest it is. It comes with 2-area ‘Intelligent Eye’ that helps detect human presence and aids in efficiency by adjusting cooling if the room has been unoccupied for 20 minutes. Daikin claims it’s good for:

Humid or dry climate zones
Purifying air in your home
Introducing outside fresh air into your home
It features a full-featured remote control, with a ‘quiet mode’ that reduces operational levels to 2-3dBA which is undetectable by most human hearing. The US7 is also compatible with the Daikin mobile phone app, which acts as a remote control. The US7 is arguably the ‘fanciest’ in Daikin’s split system range, and prices start at about $2,000.
