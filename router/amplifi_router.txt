 Modern aesthetic  Easy to set up  More expensive than competition 
While it may be more expensive than the Google Wifi for similar performance, the Amplifi HD as a clean, modern style that would make Apple jealous. While this may seem like a minor point for some, this aesthetic means that nobody will be ashamed of installing this router in a nice open space – which will only boost it’s already-great performance. In our testing we didn’t notice a difference in performance, whether right next to the main router, or upstairs next to one of the included mesh units. This is one of those routers that matches great performance with great looks – as long as you have the cash to support it.
